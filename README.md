# Recommender System Using Haskell

Almost all the applications we use today rely extensively on recommender systems to build user profiles
and accordingly recommend items to buy/watch/read that matches their usersâ€™ interests.
In this project, we build a recommender system that uses the usersâ€™ purchases history to:
 Recommend an item to the user based on their previous purchases if the current cart is empty
 If there are items already added to the users cart, recommend an item to the user based on their
previous purchases and the current items in the cart
 Another option is to recommend an item to the user based
